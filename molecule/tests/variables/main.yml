# ðŸš€ This task aims to include all assert tasks for the main variables in Molecule tests
# ðŸŽ¯ The objective is to ensure that all assert tasks are executed for comprehensive testing

# ðŸ”„ Including all assert tasks found in the 'asserts' directory
# For each .yml file in the 'asserts' directory, we include the tasks defined in the file
# This allows us to modularize our tests and keep our codebase organized
