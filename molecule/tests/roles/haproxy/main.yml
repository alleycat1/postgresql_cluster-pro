# ðŸŽ¯ The objective is to ensure that the variables used in the HAProxy configuration are correctly defined and functional

# ðŸ”„ Including variable tests for HAProxy
# This task iterates over all the YAML files in the 'variables' directory, and includes each file's tasks in the current playbook
# If a variable test fails, it will be immediately apparent, aiding in debugging and ensuring the robustness of the HAProxy configuration
