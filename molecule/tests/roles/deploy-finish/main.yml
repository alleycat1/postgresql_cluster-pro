# ðŸš€ This task is designed to include and execute a series of variable tests for the 'deploy-finish' role in our Molecule test suite.
# ðŸŽ¯ The objective is to ensure that all variable tests are run in a systematic and efficient manner, thus ensuring the integrity of our deployment process.

# ðŸ”„ Including and executing variable tests for the 'deploy-finish' role
# We use a loop to iterate over all the YAML files in the 'variables' directory, and for each file, we include its tasks in the current playbook.
# This allows us to run a comprehensive set of variable tests in an automated and efficient manner.
